# Instructions

Go to the `bin` and download the files there into your mod folder. You will still need to have Fabric API and Fabric Launcher in order to have this work. The size of the bat is variable and can be changed easily if you dislike the size. Let me know if you find any issues or have other features you want added.

## Progress
All functionality should be working, but there is a minor error which causes a few origins to appear more than once in the origin menu when you launch a world. This shouldn't impact playability and I'm frankly to lazy to fix it. Maybe I'll get around to it later.
