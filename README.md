# Most Recent version: v7

# Instructions

Download the most recent version of the `Modded_Origins.jar` file by clicking on it and then selecting download at the folowing page. This is the same file type that most mods are delivered in. I have no idea how you actually go about installing the mods, but you should be able to follow the same steps to install this file as any other mod that you install.

Currently all functionality is working except for the sizing. Working on it
